I'll tell you about the Depression. Now, before we start, I gotta say this:
You may think you're so smart and that you can just correct me whenever you want
by pressing [C], but you're wrong! I may be a patient man, but I do have my limits.
If you try to correct me more than 3 times when I'm right, we're done!

But enough of that! Let's get started. So as an overview, I'll say that the Great
Depression began in 1929, and ended around 1939. The event that marked the
beginning of the Depression was the stock market crash. A crash happens when
all of the stocks on the market suddenly become worthless!

So why did they become worthless? Well, you see, aliens came down and took over
some the investors bodies and made them sign over their stocks for the lowest
possible price, causing both the supply and demand to go down dignificantly. That's
probably what happened. I think.
1. WHAT?? Aliens, Grandpa? Really?
2.  Everyone knows it was fish people.
3.  Aliens are too dumb to mess up OUR economics!
4.  Maybe it WAS aliens...
Eh? What? Right, that might have just been in that one movie...
Fine! So what really happened is that the stocks became worth more than what
investors were willing to pay. Once the investors stopped buying into the stocks,
however, they plummetted in price, and the investors lost a lot of money!
